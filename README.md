=============

Examples from Peter Harrington's Machine Learning in Action (MLIA).

The code is __not__ a direct copy of whats in the book or in the github site, but does the same thing. I have tried to make the code shorter and (at least to me) more understandable.

Data files are not copied over. You will find the data files (of the same name as in the code) in the [book's source code site on GitHub](https://github.com/pbharrin/machinelearninginaction).
