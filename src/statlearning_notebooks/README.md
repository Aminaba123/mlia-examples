##StatLearning Notebooks##

IPython notebooks that implement the R code for the [https://class.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014/about](StatLearning: Statistical Learning) online course from Stanford University taught by Profs Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani. I attended the one that was conducted January-March 2014. The authors use the [http://www.r-project.org/](R language) for all their worked examples. Having used the [http://pandas.pydata.org/](Pandas), the Python Data Analysis Library, recently, I thought it may be a good learning exercise for me to reimplement the R code from the course with Pandas (and friends). If successful, it also gives me a basis for my belief that Python can be as effective at data analysis as R.
